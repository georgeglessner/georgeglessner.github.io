          <p> From February to December of 2018 I was a software application developer intern at Service Express. My girlfriend had been living in Arizona since July, and I knew I was going to move there after I graduated in December. I knew it was a long-shot to be offered a full time position at Service Express working in Arizona since all of the software application developers are located at corporate, where I used to work. However, Service Express worked with me in achieving my vision of continuing on as a full time developer and hired me to work full time in Arizona! </p> 

          <p> I have been living in Arizona for 3 weeks now, and finally feel as though I am settled in. I took the first week of January off to get settled in. Working regionally is not as difficult as I thought it would be. Sure, I miss being able to talk with my co-workers in person and the office life and festivities, but I am a developer and all I need is my computer to do my work. Service Express has a Phoenix office, which I go to about twice a week. There are now 4 of us that work in the office. Everyone in the office is super nice and willing to help me out whenever I need. That is the Service Express way! </p> 

          <p> I am beyond happy with where I am personally and professionally right now. Iâ€™d like to give a huge shoutout to my company and team for allowing me the opportunity to pursue my passion in a different state. I am excited to see where this adventure takes me! </p>
