        <p style="margin:5px"> From February to December of 2018 I was a software application developer intern at Service Express. My girlfriend had been living in Arizona since July, and I knew I was going to move there after I graduated in December. I knew it was a long-shot to be offered a full time position at Service Express working in Arizona since all of the software application developers are located at corporate, where I used to work. However, Service Express worked with me in achieving my vision of continuing on as a full time developer and hired me to work full time in Arizona! </p>

     <div class="wrapper">
        <p style="margin:5px"> I was tasked with implementing single sign on (SSO) for my companyâ€™s intranet as my first major project of my internship. Having no knowledge of the subject matter beforehand, I was pretty clueless. So, I thought I would try to explain in general what single sign on is and how it works.</p>

       <div class="wrapper">
          <p style="margin:5px">I started working at <a href="https://www.serviceexpress.com" target="_blank">Service Express</a> in February of this year. When I first started, I was working mostly on software tickets. The application developer team is in charge of creating and maintaining our intranet, and when things go wrong a ticket is placed. So for the first few months I was in charge of handling the software tickets. This was a great learning experience for me. Not only for improving my software development skills, but also for learning how the intranet worked.</p>
