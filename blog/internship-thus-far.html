          <p> I started working at <a href="https://www.serviceexpress.com" target="_blank">Service Express</a> in February of this year. When I first started, I was working mostly on software tickets. The application developer team is in charge of creating and maintaining our intranet, and when things go wrong a ticket is placed. So for the first few months I was in charge of handling the software tickets. This was a great learning experience for me. Not only for improving my software development skills, but also for learning how the intranet worked. </p>

          <p> Now, five months later, I have been working on my first big project. I was put in charge of implementing Single Sign On (SSO) for our company's intranet. We already have a few external applications that we have SSO enabled on, but we ultimately want to get our intranet login setup with SSO as well for ease of use for our employees as well as improved security. This project has often times been very frustrating, but I have learned so much from working on it. Our intranet runs off of two servers, so I have had to implement two separate SSO applications for each server. This project has taught me a lot about project management in a business setting as well as problem solving. </p>

          <p> I have thoroughly enjoyed my first months here at Service Express and hope to continue working on fun projects and improving my development skills along the way! </p>
